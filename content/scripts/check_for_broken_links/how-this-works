once in a while you can run 1-link_checker
- it finds broken links in masterlist.txt
- takes a while depends on number of links in masterlist.txt

then you run 2-clean.sh
- it adds broken links to masterlist.txt while keeping all the old broken links

then you should go up a directory and hop into grab_io_pages folder
and run 1.get.github.links.sh
- it removes all the current not_woking links from masterlist.txt and recreates it also recreates lucky.github.io.html


on every website update 2.get.github.links.cleaner.sh gets run
- it test new links if they are broken recreates not_woking and masterlist.txt
- it does not need to recreate lucky.github.io.html since it adds new working links to the end
